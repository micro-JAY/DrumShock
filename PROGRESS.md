# DrumShock Progress - PS5 Controller to MIDI

## Current Issue (2025-06-28)
- **Problem**: Maschine is interpreting PS5 controller inputs as keyboard commands instead of MIDI notes
- **User wants**: PS5 buttons to send MIDI notes for scene switching in Maschine
- **Screenshot provided**: Shows Maschine's MIDI Change dialog set to receive from "DrumShock Virtual Output"

## What We've Done
1. Fixed corrupted Xcode project file
2. Removed automatic scene note sending that was conflicting with pad notes
3. Created a new "Maschine Scenes" mode for dedicated scene control
4. Cleaned up the MIDI implementation

## What Still Needs Work
- The MIDI notes are still not being recognized properly by Maschine
- Need to verify:
  - MIDI channel settings (currently using channel 10)
  - Whether Maschine expects different note ranges for scenes
  - If the virtual MIDI output is properly configured in macOS

## Next Steps
1. Check if MIDI Monitor app shows the notes being sent correctly
2. Try changing MIDI channel from 10 to 1 (Maschine might expect channel 1)
3. Verify the note range Maschine expects for scene changes
4. Test with a simple MIDI monitor to ensure notes are being sent

## Code Files Modified
- `GameControllerManager.swift` - Removed automatic scene sending
- `MidiController.swift` - Added scene mode handling
- `DAWMode.swift` - Added maschineScenes mode
- `ContentView.swift` - Added UI for scene mode

## Mode Summary
- **Maschine 3**: Sends pad notes C1-B1 (36-47)
- **Maschine Scenes**: Sends scene notes C2-G2 (48-55)
